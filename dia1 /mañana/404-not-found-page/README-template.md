## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- see the application in 375px for mobile screens
- see the application from 375px and beyond on desktop mode

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your
project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height
screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to
crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot.
FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file
path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to implement adaptable resolutions for a simple 404 message. it was specially important to take
into cosideration how the code Will change according to the current size of the screen

### Continued development

We need to improve the implementation of different sizes for the containers and text depending on
the resolution and keep learning about clamp property
