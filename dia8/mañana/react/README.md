## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select the rating and submit it to be redirected to another page with a "thank you" message

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your
project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height
screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to
crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot.
FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file
path in the image above.
